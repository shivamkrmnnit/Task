How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Ans-
To address a performance issue in production, I would:
1.	Use Monitoring Tools: Track system metrics (CPU, memory, response times) with tools like New Relic or Datadog.
2.	Enable Logging: Capture errors, slow queries, and response times.
3.	Analyze Requests: Identify slow endpoints or functions.
4.	Optimize Database: Profile queries, add indexes, and optimize query plans.
5.	Profile and Load Test: Simulate load to detect inefficiencies and memory issues.
Yes, I have done this before to successfully identify and resolve bottlenecks.


Ques-
If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

Ans-
Collaborative Task Management: I would implement a feature that allows multiple users to collaborate on tasks seamlessly. This would include shared access to tasks, enabling team members to view and edit task details in real-time. Additionally, a commenting system would allow users to communicate directly within tasks, promoting efficient teamwork and reducing the need for external messaging. Real-time updates would ensure all collaborators are instantly notified of changes, enhancing productivity and collaboration within teams.
